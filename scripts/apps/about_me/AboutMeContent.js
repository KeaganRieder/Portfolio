export const BIO_TEXT = `
I’m a programmer and artist, currently attending the University of Lethbridge for a BFA in New Media 
and a BSC in Computer Science. I enjoy working with various programming languages and tools to 
create software that solves problems or generates and makes interactive artwork. When I’m not 
writing programs to make or solve problems, I’m drawing pixel art pieces or tile sets and character 
models that can be used for games.
Programming is a hobby and passion of mine, which I’ve had since middle school. I was introduced
and fell in love with the problem-solving aspects and the ability to create things with it. This passion 
led me to attend the University of Lethbridge to expand my programming skills. Well, there, I would 
find out about the new media program that covered various skills and topics, including video game 
design and development. Having a hobby of playing video games and a desire to develop and create
games, I added new media as a second major.
Besides doing school, I’m currently working on a game called Automation, which combines 
elements from automation games and colony sims to create different experiences. The game’s 
developer is currently more of a hobby, a way to practice and learn new skills.

export const ARTIST_STATEMENT_TEXT = `
I’ve always enjoyed creating digital works of art that are static images but rather change either on 
their own or by the action of the viewer, often achieved by having some degree of programming part 
of the work. The programming aspects of my work can range from accompanying pixel art pieces or 
other digital artworks to a program utilizing procedural generation techniques to create new work 
from something semi or fully random.
The ability to create something with meaning from something semi or purely random is one of many 
things that inspire my work. Sense-creating works from randomness can allow for a piece with 
elements that can unpredictably change, creating an entirely different experience. Especially when 
accompanied by adding interactivity through code, it can lead to the work being able to change 
based on the viewer.
Overall, I strive to create pieces that combine digital art with the strengths code to create works 
that can be interacted with and experienced in many ways.
