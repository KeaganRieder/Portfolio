export const Biography: string = `
I am a programmer and artist pursuing a BSC in Computer Science and a BFA in New Media 
at the University of Lethbridge. My academic background allows me to combine technical 
expertise with creative problem-solving, particularly in software development, interactive 
media, and game design.\n

I enjoy working with a variety of programming languages to design software solutions and 
develop interactive experiences. Alongside coding, I create pixel art, tile sets, and 
character modelsâ€”skills that complement my interest in game development.\n

My passion for programming is rooted in a strong enjoyment of problem-solving and innovation. 
This drive led me to computer science, where I focus on building technical skills, and later 
to the New Media program, where I explore the creative applications of technology in game 
design and digital art. By pursuing both fields, I aim to develop a well-rounded skill set 
that bridges technical development and artistic design.

I strive to merge digital art and programming to create interactive works that offer unique 
and engaging experiences. My practice spans from generating pixel art and digital illustrations 
to developing procedural systems that produce entirely new creations from randomness.\n

A central inspiration in my work is the challenge of deriving meaning from the unpredictable. 
By incorporating semi- or fully-randomized elements, I aim to create pieces with an ever-evolving 
nature, inviting viewers to encounter something fresh with each interaction. Adding interactivity 
through code allows my work to respond dynamically, making every experience distinct and personal.
