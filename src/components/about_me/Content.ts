export const Biography: string = `I'm a programmer and artist, currently attending the University of Lethbridge for a BFA in New Media and a BSc in Computer Science. 
I enjoy working with various programming languages and tools to create software that solves problems or generates and makes interactive artwork. 
When I'm not writing programs to make or solve problems, I'm drawing pixel art pieces, tile sets, and character models that can be used for games. 

Programming is a hobby and passion of mine, which I've had since middle school. I was introduced to and fell in love with the problem-solving aspects and the ability to create things with it. 
This passion led me to attend the University of Lethbridge to expand my programming skills. While there, I would find out about the new media program that covered various skills and topics, including video game design and development. 
Having a hobby of playing video games and a desire to develop and create games, I added new media as a second major. 

Besides school work, I'm currently working on a game, which combines elements from automation games and colony sims to create different experiences. 
The game's development is currently more of a hobby, a way to practice and learn new skills.`;

export const ArtistStatement: string = `I strive to blend digital art and code to create interactive works that offer unique experiences. 
The programming side of my work spans from generating pixel art pieces and digital illustrations to creating procedural systems that bring something entirely new from randomness. 

One of my main inspirations is the challenge of deriving meaning from the unpredictable. By embracing semi- or fully-randomized elements, I aim to create pieces with an ever-evolving nature, inviting viewers to experience something fresh with each interaction. 
Adding interactivity through code allows the work to respond dynamically to each viewer, making every encounter distinct and personal.`;
