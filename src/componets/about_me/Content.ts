export const Biography: string = `I’m a programmer and artist, currently attending the University of Lethbridge for a BFA in New Media and a BSC in Computer Science. I enjoy working with various programming languages and tools to create software that solves problems or generates and makes interactive artwork. When I’m not writing programs to make or solve problems, I’m drawing pixel art pieces or tile sets and character models that can be used for games. Programming is a hobby and passion of mine, which I’ve had since middle school. I was introduced and fell in love with the problem-solving aspects and the ability to create things with it. This passion led me to attend the University of Lethbridge to expand my programming skills. Well, there, I would find out about the new media program that covered various skills and topics, including video game design and development. Having a hobby of playing video games and a desire to develop and create games, I added new media as a second major. Besides doing school, I’m currently working on a game called Automation, which combines elements from automation games and colony sims to create different experiences. The game’s developer is currently more of a hobby, a way to practice and learn new skills.`;
